# NetApp CIFS share to volume/qtree path mappings, for check_netapp-du
# Last updated 2012-05-14 by Peter Mc Aulay
#
# Syntax:
# host:share:path
#
# The host is the hostname from Nagios.  The share is the CIFS share name as
# passed from Nagios.  The path doesn't need to be exactly correct, just good
# enough for check_netapp-du to find.  Lines beginning with '#' are ignored.
#

# Examples:
#fileserver01:home$:/vol/v_homedir_1/
#fileserver01:webstat:/vol/v_d100v1/itcost/webstat
#fileserver02:DR:/vol/v_application/DR
#fileserver02:ESX$:/vol/v_esx
#fileserver21:www3_prd:/vol/v_nfs21/db/www3_prd
